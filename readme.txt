Turns every image on your website into a discussion board.

== Description ==

There are so many interesting things happened on a photo, but there isn’t a single way to directly discuss them on the spot. Therefore, in order to achieve visual discussion, here is Ziltag Wordpress Pugin, a JavaScript plugin that turns every image on your website into a discussion board. You and your readers can comment on any spot on any image, where discussion should really happen.

Ziltag is the discussion board on images and it connects everyone with everything happens in images. It presents contents directly on images with tags (red blinking dots) that users can click to read and join the conversation immediately, and turns every image on the website into individual message board that users can write, collaborate, showcase, or share contents with others.
